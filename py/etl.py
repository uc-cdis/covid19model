### ETL script for generating input tables to model
### main point: ETL JHU covid-19 case and mortality data

# todo: refactor

## HERE! -> not handled here in python -> Serial Interval Table -> would be worthwhile to reproduce the R for that here
## "serial interval table" <--> that discretized gamma distribution
## so that this script does indeed produce all the required input tables for the model
## alternatively, could just generate that discretized gamma distribution in the R code itself, pre-simulation
## I don't like that idea -> will try to reproduce results in python - but not now -> other more pressing tasks now
